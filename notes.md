*Exercise 3.1*
Can turn any triangular number into an (n + 1) x n by reflecting across the horizontal axis, e.g. for six we have the 4 x 3 box:

    a a a b
    a a b b
    a b b b

Then we can compose four of these together geometrically and add a single center piece

     _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    |     |       |
    |     |       |
    |     |_ _ _ _|
    |_ _ _|_|     |
    |       |     |
    |       |     |
    |_ _ _ _|_ _ _|

which gives us an (w + h) x (w + h) square ("square" number).


*Exercise 3.4*
Yes, there are palindromic primes > 1000.  The lack of them in the interval [1000, 2000] is due to the fact
that the only possible palindromic primes in that range would take the form of 1XX1, but each of these numbers
(1111, 1221, 1331, ...) is divisible by 11.
